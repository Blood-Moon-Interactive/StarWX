# StarWX - Astronomical Events & Weather Forecasting

## Project Overview
StarWX is a web application that combines astronomical events, space launches, and weather forecasting to help users determine optimal viewing conditions for celestial events. The platform provides location-based recommendations for viewing comets, meteor showers, eclipses, and space launches based on local weather conditions.
